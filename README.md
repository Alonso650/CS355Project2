# CS355Project2
This project was done in my Database Management class at Sonoma State University. The purpose of this project is to be able to work with databases by creating a database and storing information into the database. For my project, I decided to create a database that focuses on animal shelters where different shelters can be created, then when an entry for an animal is created, they can get assigned to a specific shelter. Other data entries that can be stored into the database are volunteers and clients. The volunteers can be assigned to multiple shelters, or they can get deleted from the database once they are no longer a volunteer. Client information can be stored in the database to record whether they surrendered an animal or adopted an animal.

The languages/technologies used to create this project are JavaScript, HTML, and MySQL. Shelters, animals, volunteers, and clients all have the same options of creating new entries, updating data information and deleting them from the database.
